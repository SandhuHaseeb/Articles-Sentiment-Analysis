# Articles-Sentiment-Analysis
The ever-growing volume of online news necessitates efficient methods for sentimentanalysis. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based model to automatically classify news articles as positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment,
We will explore two distinct deep learning architectures for this task:

**Method 1: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
We will use a CNN with an embedding layer to capture semantic
relationships between words in the news articles. The CNN will learn
to identify patterns in these word embeddings that correlate with positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment

**Method 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network:**
We will utilize an LSTM network to leverage the sequential nature of
textdata. LSTMs excel at capturing long-term dependencies between
words,which can be crucial for understanding the overall sentiment of
a news article, especially when dealing with sarcasm or complex
sentence structures.
