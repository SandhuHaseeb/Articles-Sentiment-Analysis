Mark Cuban launches generic drug company,Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.,1,"Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has launched a generic drug company called the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company.

The new company's website says it is dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs and pledges to ""provide radical transparency in how we price our drugs.""

The Cost Plus company will publish the costs to manufacture, distribute and market its drugs to pharmacies. It said it adds a 15 percent margin to get its wholesale prices and make sure it remains profitable, but that there are no middlemen and no rebates for insurance companies.

""Everybody gets the same low price for every drug we make,"" the company website states.

The first drug it will produce is albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. The company is hoping to introduce more than 100 drugs by the end of 2021, as well as build a pharmaceutical factory in Dallas by 2022.



The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company has also partnered with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to aid researchers in providing care for children with hookworm infection in rural Alabama.

From Defendant to Defender: One Wrongfully Convicted Man Frees Another,"Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned. Becomes a lawyer and is now helping overturn other false convictions.",1,"Attorney Jarrett Adams recently helped overturn an innocent man's conviction — in the same state that, years ago, had sentenced him to prison for a crime he did not commit.

The case was Adams' first professional win. But it was also deeply personal for the 36-year-old, who spent nearly 10 years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in a case that Adams, who is black, believes was tainted by racism.

""This is a storybook,"" Adams told NBC News' Lester Holt. ""It's a storybook tale that you wouldn't believe until you saw it ... to have a conviction overturned and in a court, in a state, that I was wrongfully convicted.""

Adams was only 17 when an encounter at a party, an accusation, and a court-appointed attorney put his life on hold.

He had just finished high school on Chicago's South Side and decided to go to the University of Wisconsin for a party, where he and his friends met a young woman and had what he describes as a ""completely consensual encounter from beginning to end.""

Three weeks later, as Adams was getting ready to start junior college in the fall of 1998, he was arrested. An officer informed him that the woman said she was raped, and that he was being charged with a group sexual assault along with two other teenagers.

Adams had never been arrested before. He denied the crime from the start, and thought the misunderstanding would get resolved quickly.

Instead, he was extradited to Wisconsin, where he couldn't afford legal assistance. A court-appointed attorney chose not to put on a defense, even though there was a witness who could have helped clear Adams: a student living in the dorm who could corroborate Adams' timeline of events.

""This guy is telling us, 'We know you didn't do it. They haven't proven their case. The best defense is a no-defense strategy,'"" Adams said. ""We're like, 'Yeah, sounds good,' because we didn't know any better, right? But in reality, it was a horrible idea to not call any witnesses, not to investigate, and to put this in front of an all-white, racially charged jury. We didn't stand a chance.""

The result was a conviction with a stunning 28-year prison sentence for Adams; 20 years for another teen who couldn't pay for representation; and an acquittal for the third, who had hired a private lawyer, and called the alibi witness.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years,"" Adams said.

Inside prison, Adams met a cellmate who worked for the prison law library and encouraged him to try to get his conviction overturned.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years.""

""He said, 'Listen. I go over hundreds of inmates' cases, and all of them say the same thing: I'm innocent.' He said, 'I've never seen a case like yours before. You're in here for some racist bull crap, and you've essentially waved the white flag,'"" Adams said.

The cellmate urged him not to give up: ""It's only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don't care at all. You need to go down swinging,"" he told Adams.

So, Adams started reading law books and found a Supreme Court case that stated that the Constitution required defendants be provided effective assistance of counsel. He got in touch with attorney Keith Findley with the Wisconsin Innocence Project, a state chapter of the nonprofit devoted to justice for wrongfully convicted people.

Findley knew the case was an uphill battle, but he took it on.

""He had done his homework. He knew the case, factually, better than anybody, and he knew the law, so that he was engaging with us, discussing legal issues, strategy,"" Findley said.

Adams' sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped, for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books: ineffective assistance of counsel.

A month after he was freed in 2007, Adams enrolled in community college, went on to earn his Bachelor's degree and attended law school, graduating in 2015.

Last summer, he became the first Innocence Project exonoree to be hired as an attorney by the organization.

""What I wanted more than anything was this: I wanted my mother, when she went to church and people asked about her son, for her not to duck her head in her Bible and cry. And I wanted her to be proud,"" he said.

Recently, Adams found himself back in a Wisconsin courtroom, this time working side-by-side with his former attorney Findley, to free another man they believed was wrongfully convicted.

Richard Beranek was convicted of rape in 1990. Although he had alibi witnesses that put him in another state at the time of the rape, the jury found the testimony of an FBI expert tying him to the scene through a microscopic hair analysis convincing enough to deliver a guilty verdict.

Adams — who served time in the same correctional facility as his client — was dedicated to freeing him, Findley said.

""I can talk to Richard about what I've seen other exonerees go through, what the experience looks like from the outside, but I couldn't do what Jarrett can do. I couldn't speak with the authenticity of knowing what it feels like, that Jarrett can speak to,"" Findley said.

In June, a Dane County circuit judge overturned Beranek's conviction, citing DNA evidence that proves the FBI hair analysis was wrong. Beranek is now a free man, in large part thanks to Adams' tireless work.

""Nothing pays me back more, or my family, than me walking in the same court, in the same state, where they didn't even look at me when they gave me 28 years,"" Adams said. ""But now they have to acknowledge me as 'Attorney Adams.'""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/defendant-defender-one-wrongfully-convicted-man-frees-another-n788886
"Amazon Tribe Wins Lawsuit Against Big Oil, Saving Millions Of Acres Of Rainforest",Amazon tribe wins legal battle against oil companies. Preventing drilling in Amazon Rainforest,1,"The Amazon Rainforest is well known across the world for being the largest and most dense area of woodland in the world. Spanning across nine countries, the Amazon is home to millions of different animal and plant species, as well as harboring some for the world’s last remaining indigenous groups. The Waorani people of Pastaza are an indigenous tribe from the Ecuadorian Amazon and have lived in the Rainforest for many generations. However, there Home came under threat from a large oil company - they didn’t take it lightly.

Legal Win

After a long legal battle with a number of organizations, the Waorani people successfully protected half a million acres of their ancestral territory in the Amazon rainforest from being mined for oil drilling by huge oil corporations. The auctioning off of Waorani lands to the oil companies was suspended indefinitely by a three-judge panel of the Pastaza Provincial Court. The panel simply trashed the consultation process the Ecuadorian government had undertaken with the tribe in 2012, which rendered the attempt at land purchase null and void.

This win for the indigenous tribe has now set an invaluable legal precedent for other indigenous nations across the Ecuadorian Amazon. After accepting a Waorani bid for court protection to stop an oil bidding process, the court also halted the potential auctioning off of 16 oil blocks that cover over 7 million acres of indigenous territory.

Government Corruption

While there is no evidence, some people believe that the Ecuadorian government may be accepting bribes in some roundabout way. The land in question is meant to be protected under Ecuador’s constitution that establishes the inalienable, unseizable and indivisible rights of indigenous people to maintain possession of their ancestral lands and obtain their free adjudication.

Furthermore, the constitution also states that there is a need for prior consultation on any plans to exploit the underground resources, given the probable environmental and cultural impacts on tribal communities. The government claim they did do this in 2012, however, the tribe alleges that the agreement they came to was based upon fraudulent practices in favor of the oil companies and the government was favoring their bottom line over the people the actually still live on this valuable land. Due to this, the judges ordered the Ecuadorian government to conduct a new consultation, applying standards set by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights before anything else is agreed regarding the exploitation of the natural resources below the ground.

Nemonte Nenquimo, president of the Waorani Pastaza Organization and plaintiff in the lawsuit, remarked:

“The government tried to sell our lands to the oil companies without our permission. Our rainforest is our life. We decide what happens in our lands. We will never sell our rainforest to the oil companies. Today, the courts recognized that the Waorani people, and all indigenous peoples have rights over our territories that must be respected. The government’s interests in oil is not more valuable than our rights, our forests, our lives.”

This is a major win for indigenous tribes all over the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and even perhaps the Amazon as a whole! This has definitely set a new precedent regarding indigenous peoples’ rights over the land they live in and offers them a glimmer of hope in protecting their cultural heritage. They’ll definitely need plenty of support in the coming years as economical advances, such as this one will keep coming more and more as the world becomes ever growingly desperate for the natural resources that the beautiful land holds.",https://www.disclose.tv/amazon-tribe-wins-lawsuit-against-big-oil-saving-millions-of-acres-of-rainforest-367412
"Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program","Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program",1,"Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program

Newark police and city officials say a de-escalation training program is working, especially in a year faced with challenges.

Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose says 2020 was the roughest year in his 34-year career in law enforcement.

Six of their 1,100 officers lost their lives to COVID-19 with dozens more officers sick after being exposed on the job.

They also faced major challenges during the summer's anti-police brutality protests.

Through it all, Ambrose says not one officer in the city fired his or her weapon while on duty in 2020.

""It was the unknown. It was the unknown that you didn’t know with this disease that you were coming here every day, and these police officers and firefighters going out there, and we didn't know,"" says Ambrose.

For Newark police, it was a year of COVID-19 fears, obstacles and losses.

“We lost six police officers and going to six funerals, it all wears on you,"" Ambrose says.

There was also the major tension on the streets of the city, following the death of George Floyd.

“We had protests, and they tried to take over of one of our precincts,"" Ambrose says.

2020 was tough for the Newark Police Department. But despite all of that, top brass report an impressive statistic to round out 2020.

Ambrose says not one police officer fired a weapon in 2020. He credits a de-escalation program implemented in Newark two years go.

""These things, it takes time for it to work. And I think it worked,"" Ambrose says.

Overall crime was down 6% this year. The city saw 51 homicides, the same as 2019. Non-fatal shootings were up in the city, and 61 of them had multiple victims.

But more guns were taken off the streets. Police officers recovered 496 illegal firearms, a 7% increase over last year when officers took 461 illegal weapons off the street.

""I'm proud of the men and women of Newark police division who took the guns off the street this year. Didn't fire a shot, came to work during a pandemic, arrested people with guns during the pandemic,"" Ambrose says.

Ambrose says the true test of that training was on May 30 during a Black Lives Matter protest in which about 1,700 people swarmed a precinct in an attempt to take it over. Not one shot was fired during the incident and nobody was severely injured.

Last year, police fired five shots, but there are no details on whether that was at one incident or multiple.",https://newjersey.news12.com/newark-police-no-officer-fired-a-single-shot-in-2020-thanks-to-de-escalation-program?fbclid=IwAR1rFcNUaz69b4CsG0y_mzYQ-09k1CJYSeDgmRI6PbO2csktuHxKMswnYOw
Ingen barn døde i trafikken i 2019,No children died in traffic accidents in Norway in 2019,1,"I 1970 døde det 560 mennesker i den norske trafikken, og direktør Ingrid Dahl Hovland i Statens vegvesen mener det siden den gang har vært en gledelig utvikling.

– Vi er flinke til å sikre våre barn i bil, men jeg skulle ønske vi var like flinke å sikre de voksne. Våre analyser av dødsulykkene viser at 33 prosent av alle som omkom i en bil, ikke har brukt sikkerhetsbelter. Mange av disse ville ha reddet livet om de hadde brukt sikkerhetsbelte, mener Hovland.

Dyster desember

Vegdirektør Ingrid Dahl Hovland er fornøyd med utviklingen når det gjelder barn som omkommer i den norske trafikken. Foto: Knut Opeide

I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. I desember mistet 14 personer livet i trafikken, som er mer enn en dobling fra desember i fjor hvor seks personer omkom.

– Vi er ikke fornøyd med at vi ikke får dødstallene ytterligere ned. Bak hver eneste ulykke er det en tragedie som rammer familie, venner, kolleger og lokalsamfunn, sier Ingrid Dahl Hovland.

Antallet omkomne for de tre siste årene ligger omtrent på samme nivå, og ligger på mellom 106 og 110 omkomne.

– Før desember hadde vi et lite håp om at 2019 kunne bli et år med færrest omkomne i trafikken noensinne. Dessverre ble desember en langt dystrere måned i trafikken enn forventet, og vi er fortsatt langt unna nullvisjonen om at ingen skal omkomme eller bli hardt skadd i trafikken.

– Vi må derfor styrke innsatsen betydelig innen trafikksikkerhetsarbeid i årene som kommer. Det er langt igjen før vi er der vi skal være, mener direktør i Trygg Trafikk, Jan Johansen.

Mange ulykker med tunge kjøretøy

I nesten hver tredje dødsulykke i fjor var tunge kjøretøy involvert. Det betyr at tunge kjøretøy har vært involvert i 36 av dødsulykkene i fjor. Dette er det høyeste antallet de siste fem årene.

Direktør Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk er bekymret over alle dødsulykkene hvor tunge kjøretøy er involvert. Foto: Trygg Trafikk

– Det er mange tunge kjøretøy på veiene og dette kommer bare til å øke i tiden framover. Ulykkesanalysene viser at det ofte ikke er sjåføren i det tunge kjøretøyet som har skyld i ulykken, og derfor må vi bilister være ekstra oppmerksomme, sier Johansen.

Flest ulykker i Nordland

16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland i 2019, og det var verst i hele landet.

– Tallene for Nordland er bekymringsfulle. Nordland har mange smale og svingete veier av dårlig standard og det er det nødvendig med tiltak både når det gjelder infrastruktur for å heve veistandarden, sier Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk.

Trafikktall for 2019 Ekspandér faktaboks I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. 16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland, og det er en kraftig økning fra 2018, da fem personer omkom. Bak følger Akershus (14), Trøndelag (11) og Møre og Romsdal (10). Finnmark, Oslo og Aust-Agder hadde færrest dødsulykker med en drept i hvert av disse fylkene. I 2019 omkom 79 menn og 31 kvinner i den norske trafikken. Det betyr at over 71 prosent av de omkomne var menn. Dødsfall i trafikken øker mest i aldersgruppen 25-44, mens det er størst nedgang i gruppen 45-64 år.



I 2019 var det dobbelt så mange bilpassasjerer som omkom enn året før. Det er likevel fortsatt flest bilførere som dør i trafikken. I fjor var det ingen dødsulykker med moped, og det har ikke skjedd siden 2010.

Statens vegvesen lover fortsatt storsatsing mot trafikkdøden og alvorlig skadde i trafikken.

– Vårt viktigste våpen er kunnskap. Vi analyserer alle dødsulykkene, og denne kunnskapen gjør at vi kan sette inn tiltak som vi vet virker og som har stor effekt.

"Budweiser will sit out Super Bowl, funneling marketing dollars to boost vaccine awareness","Budweiser will sit out Super Bowl, funneling marketing dollars to boost vaccine awareness",1,"Budweiser will not be running a commercial during the Super Bowl for the first time in 37 years.

Instead, the Anheuser-Busch InBev beer will use the marketing dollars to support Covid-19 vaccine awareness and access.

As of Friday, roughly 39 million vaccines doses had been distributed and only 19.1 million administered, falling well short of the targets set by the federal government.

In the week leading up to Super Bowl LV, Budweiser plans to run its Super Bowl ad digitally. The spot focuses on resilient Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, including a group of health-care workers who were the first to receive the vaccine. Actress Rashida Jones, known for her roles in ""The Office"" and ""Parks and Recreation,"" will narrate the spot.

The beer brand also plans to donate a percentage of its advertising airtime for 2021 to the Ad Council and Covid Collaborative's Vaccine Education Initiative. Budweiser will support its efforts with additional campaigns throughout the year.

Alice Sylvester, the co-founder of Sequent Partners, a marketing measurement analytics consultancy, said that Budweiser is taking purpose-driven marketing to the next level and differentiating itself from Super Bowl advertisers whose commercials will air during the game.

""It speaks to the long tail impact of Super Bowl advertising, which is as much about brand building than it is about short term revenue generation,"" Sylvester said.

The company also isn't entirely giving up promoting its beer. Budweiser is giving U.S. consumers who are at least 21 years old a free beer when they visit ABeerOnBud.com between Jan. 25 and Feb. 7. AB InBev's other brands, including Michelob Ultra, Bud Light and Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade, will have in-game ads during the Super Bowl.

Budweiser isn't the only iconic brand sitting out the game. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have said they won't be running in-game ads for their namesake sodas. Pepsi is instead focusing on its sponsorship of the halftime show, which stars The Weeknd. PepsiCo's other brands, including Mtn Dew and Frito-Lay, are planning on airing commercials during the game.

In a statement to CNBC, Coke said it has chosen to focus on ""investing in the right resources."" The pandemic has upended the beverage giant's business because fewer drinks are being consumed away from home. Its revenue fell 13% during the first nine months of 2020.

Last year's Super Bowl drew about 100 million viewers, but attracting those eyeballs comes with a hefty price tag for advertisers. A 30-second commercial during the football game will set companies back about $5.5 million this year, slightly less than 2020's rate of $5.6 million.

Shares of Budweiser parent AB InBev have fallen 14.5% in the last year, giving the company a market value of about $113 billion. While at-home consumption of beer is up due to the pandemic, the blow to bars and sports stadiums has resulted in a 6.8% revenue decline during the first nine months of 2020.",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/super-bowl-budweiser-to-sit-out-the-big-game-fund-covid-vaccine-ads.html
Tesla’s Elon Musk donates $5 million to free education platform Khan Academy,Elon Musk donates $5 million to free education platform Khan Academy,1,"By

Elon Musk, through the The Musk Foundation, has donated $5 million to American non-profit educational organization Khan Academy, which seeks to help students and teachers across the globe by providing access to free, world-class education. The donation was shared by Khan Academy founder, Salman Khan, who thanked the CEO in a YouTube video.

In his message, Khan noted that The Musk Foundation‘s $5 million donation would go a long way towards accelerating the academy’s projects. With about 20 to 30 million students using the Khan Academy’s platform every month, after all, Musk’s $5 million donation can provide a notable boost to the non-profit’s programs.

Thank you @elonmusk and @MuskFoundation for an incredible $5m donation to @khanacademy. Here is my thank you video:https://t.co/1LyABVmTyt — Salman Khan (@salkhanacademy) January 12, 2021

“Elon, I hope you really feel good about this. This is going to allow us to accelerate all sorts of content. Our aspirations are all subjects from K through the early stages of college. This will accelerate our science content, allow us to do more on early learning, allow us to make the software and practice that much more engaging for millions of students around the world, for teachers around the world,” Khan said.

Inasmuch as Elon Musk’s $5 million donation will go a long way, Khan noted that the academy still needs far more resources in the near future. The founder noted that the online academy is operating at a budget that’s about comparable to that of a large school, but it has aspirations to cater to students across the globe. With this in mind, Musk’s donation could hopefully accelerate some support for the initiative, which has touched so many lives across the globe.

Khan Academy aims to provide a free, personalized learning experience to every student, mainly built on videos that are hosted through YouTube. The academy’s website supports the videos, offering students and teachers features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. Mobile app support is also available.

At the age of just 13, Nadia Sparkes, otherwise known as 'Trash Girl', already has enough achievements under her belt to make the average adult envious.

Over the past few years, Nadia's commitment to litter picking on her cycle to school has made headlines.

Last January we ran a story about her achievements and how children at her local school had bullied her, naming her 'Trash Girl', a title she has since proudly owned.

After the article went viral, the bullying eased off for a few months but then escalated again.

Unfortunately, she felt her school did not support her and she says she was disappointed when the headteacher suggested she give up litter picking to ease off the bullies.

Despite this, Nadia continued to litter pick and has now gained a large following on Instagram and Facebook, with supporters worldwide.

Last year Nadia was honoured as part of our Stars of Norfolk and Waveney Awards, withher prize being that she spent time in the newsroom showing us the importance of recycling and what things to look out for on a litter pick.

During a short trip around Norwich city centre we collected a full tote bag worth of cans, sandwich boxes and bottles.

Alcohol cans seemed to be a main offender in the city centre, with many bottles next to a bin.

Most people do not realise that what is dropped will go down a drain, end up in the river and then wind up on the beaches.

The closer you look the worse it gets.

Nadia, from Hellesdon, has now left her old school and is about to start at Reepham High School, which is renowned for being very eco conscious.

Nadia said she was 'very excited about the move' and looked forward to being part of the school and spreading her message.

"JetBlue, American, Delta cap ticket prices out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma",JetBlue caps direct flight ticket prices out of Florida at $99 ahead of Hurricane Irma,1,"REUTERS/Mike Blake

JetBlue (JBLU) is capping its ticket prices in every city in Florida where the airline operates so people can evacuate as Hurricane Irma barrels through the Caribbean.

JetBlue will charge a maximum of $99 up to the last available seat for direct flights and a maximum of $159 up to the last available seat for connecting flights, a JetBlue representative told Yahoo Finance. That includes government taxes.

The airline has also added flights to its schedule out of select cities where they have aircraft available.

For existing reservations, JetBlue is waiving cancellation fees as well as waiving change fees and differences in air fare for rebooking.

“Given that many Floridians are struggling to get out of harm’s way, this is welcome news,” Florida Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) said in an emailed statement sent by a spokesman. “I hope more airlines do the right thing and follow suit.”

Other airlines followed JetBlue’s lead.

On Wednesday afternoon, American Airlines (AAL) said it would also cap its airfares.

“While there are limited seats remaining before the storm hits, we will cap our pre-tax fares at $99 for MainCabin seats on direct, single leg flights out of Florida for tickets sold through Sunday Sept. 10 for travel until Sept. 13,” a spokeswoman said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.

A spokesman for Delta (DAL) told Yahoo Finance that the airline reduced the price level of its highest fares, which are “typically seen when customers are booking last-minute travel and inventory is limited.”

“In addition, we are waiving change fees for customers who want to change their flight plans due to the forecast. We have full details on the waiver at delta.com,” the Delta spokesman said. “We also are adding flights and increasing the size of the aircraft we’re using on flights to and from San Juan and south Florida, providing more opportunities for customers to leave. New flights are being added to and from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West, all to Atlanta (where people can connect to destinations across the U.S.).”

Story continues

Delta is capping fares at $399 on flights out of Florida and the impacted islands. New flights are being added from Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West to Atlanta, the spokesman confirmed to Yahoo Finance.

United Airlines (UAL) added six additional flights in Florida with airfare capped at $399. Those additional flights have already sold out, according to a spokesperson.

A number of travelers had complained of steep airfares as they scrambled to book tickets to flee the storm. Some had even noticed prices above $1,000.

Here’s what the fares look like on JetBlue’s website at the time of this article’s publication.

A mysterious grey-hat is patching people's outdated MikroTik routers,A hacker is breaking into people's routers and patching them so they can't be abused by other hackers.,1,"Botnet beast: How to slay the DDoS dragon Watch Now

A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers, botnet herders, or other cyber-criminals, ZDNet has learned.

The hacker, who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator, claims to have disinfected over 100,000 MikroTik routers already.

Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.

Also: Best VPN services of 2020: Safe and fast don't come for free

""I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network,"" Alexey said. ""In the comments, I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel, where it was possible for them to ask questions.""

But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100,000 users, Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said ""thanks,"" but most were outraged.

The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.

At the time, the vulnerability (known as CVE-2018-14847) was a zero-day, but MikroTik rolled out a fix in record time. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.

CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username & password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.

For the past five and a half months, the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [1, 2] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [1, 2].

This wouldn't be an issue, but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.

Security researcher Troy Mursch told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet, over 420,000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.

Speaking to ZDNet today, Ankit Anubhav, a security researcher for NewSky Security, has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control, but failing.

""The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit, and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet,"" Anubhav said.

Instead, he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the ""work of a knowledgeable lone actor.""

Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers released a new exploit named ""By The Way"" for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.

But the reason why Alexey was able to ""clean"" over 100,000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.

""The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices, so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers, can,"" Anubhav told ZDNet.

Fortunately, Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking, Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions, it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.

Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal, but he is definitely not the first.

In 2014, a hacker accessed thousands of ASUS routers and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers, warning users to patch their ASUS device.

In late 2015, a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of the White Team launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point, the White Team's botnet became so big it battled with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.

In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named The Janit0r deployed the BrickerBot malware that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.

Also in 2017, a hacker made over 150,000 printers spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.

In 2018, another vigilante renamed tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers to ""HACKED"" and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.

Mursch told ZDNet that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.

""Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this,"" he said. ""Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.""

The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes, but are so-called ""edge"" devices, often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure, such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.

Another source in the infosec community who spoke to ZDNet but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers, not only those found in people's homes.

""Ironically, by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well,"" the unnamed researcher told us.

As for MikroTik, the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws, fixing issues within hours or days, compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months, but, yet again, it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.

"Colorado governor to mass-pardon 2,700-plus marijuana convictions","Colorado governor to mass-pardon 2,700-plus marijuana convictions",1,"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis plans to mass-pardon 2,732 convictions of low-level marijuana possession through an executive order Thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority.

“This really catches Coloradans up with where the law is today,” he told The Denver Post.

House Bill 1424, passed by the General Assembly earlier this year, included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana — the current legal limit for medical marijuana users.

Polis’ pardon, however, will only apply to convictions in state courts through 2012 of up to 1 ounce for recreational use, consistent with Colorado Amendment 64, passed by voters in 2012.

It will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states.

The governor said his office worked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions. The total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge.

Unlike programs in Denver and Boulder to expunge marijuana convictions, those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply. In the first six months of Denver’s program, fewer than 1% of the 13,000 people eligible successfully got their convictions erased.

Other states have taken action to address previous low-level convictions after marijuana legalization. Nevada, for instance, automatically pardoned more than 15,000, and California has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions.

Minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs, student loans or concealed-carry permits, Polis said.

“In addition to being symbolic, (the pardon) has real-life ramifications for people,” he said.

Anyone who wants to check if Polis’ pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons.com.

The pardon won’t expunge or seal records related to the convictions, according to the governor’s office. But the convictions will be removed from individuals’ public records, so if a member of the public runs a background check, a conviction won’t show up. It would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor’s pardon.

That’s the next goal for Rep. James Coleman, a Denver Democrat and one of the sponsors of House Bill 1424.

“Whether it’s one or a thousand (people), my focus is to figure out by the time I’m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records,” Coleman said.

He plans to look at more policies in the 2021 legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry.",https://www.denverpost.com/2020/10/01/colorado-marijuana-convictions-pardons-governor-polis/
High School Student Nicknamed ‘Trash Girl’ by Bullies Refuses to Stop Collecting Litter,High School Student Nicknamed ‘Trash Girl’ by Bullies Refuses to Stop Collecting Litter,1,"Many people may not want to think about our plastic pollution problem, but it’s imperative that we do. Every year, we produce 300 million tons of plastic and around 8.8 million tons of it get dumped in the oceans, threatening countless animals, many of which are on the verge of extinction as a result. If that wasn’t bad enough, it’s now estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

As one of the greatest threats to our oceans and the animals that we share the planet with, we need to rethink every single aspect of how much waste we produce and how we deal with it. That’s why 12-year-old Nadia Sparkes decided to take matters into her own hands. The high schooler has been picking up trash along the two-mile route from her school to her home for months now, using the basket of her bike to bring the trash home. In just the short amount of time that she has been picking up trash, Nadia has already accumulated more than two recycling bins worth of plastic.

Despite her green intentions, some of the kids at Nadia’s school have dubbed her “Trash Girl” and have bullied her for her noble efforts to help the planet. It would be easy to succumb to mean comments and stop picking up trash, but on the contrary, Nadia is more determined than ever to clean up her community.

“I’m doing something to protect the world they also live in. It’s everyone’s job. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe, instead of believing that it’s always someone else’s job,” Nadia said about the bullies.

“I told her she had two choices, she could either stop collecting rubbish, stop drawing their attention and hopefully they would leave her alone. Or she could own “trash girl,” Paula Sparkes, Nadia’s mom, said about the bullies.

As a result of the media attention Nadia has received, she now has created a Facebook group aptly named “Team Trash Girl” where she shares updates on her efforts. Positive comments have poured in, all in support of Nadia, advocating for her to ignore the negative. “Nadia, I think you’re truly awesome! Own that nickname and don’t give up. The bullies are ignorant and should be ashamed. I wish more people were just like you,” Emma Whitmore said.

Local artists have also shown their support by creating original artwork that boldly says “Team Trash Girl.”

If you’d like to stay up to date on Nadia’s work to rid her community of trash, you can join the “Team Trash Girl” Facebook group. At a time when our plastic pollution has become a full-blown environmental crisis, Nadia’s efforts are important now more than ever. We need more people like Nadia to proudly stand up for what they believe in!

What You Can Do!

A staggering 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide, according to the Earth Policy Institute. Plastic bags are made out of non-renewable resources like petroleum and natural gas, and because they take hundreds of years to decompose, when plastics do eventually degrade, they don’t biodegrade. Instead, they photodegrade, which means they break down into smaller fragments and easily soak up toxins, which then contaminate waterways, soil, and animals upon digestion of the plastic materials.

If we all make an effort to identify where we use plastic and actively look for alternatives, we can drastically cut down on the amount of plastic pollution that finds its way into the oceans. Achieving a 100 percent waste-free lifestyle is challenging, but it is certainly not impossible. Just take a look at Lauren Singer, the 25-year-old who can store all the waste she’s produced in the past few years in just a single mason jar!

As the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement, One Green Planet believes that reducing everyday plastics from our lives is not about giving up anything or sacrificing convenience, but rather learning to reap the maximum benefits from the items you use every day while having minimal impact.

Finland to offer new fathers as much paid leave as mothers,Finland to offer new fathers as much paid leave as mothers,1,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s woman-led centre-left government plans to give new fathers the same amount of paid time off work as new mothers, nearly doubling paternity leave, it announced on Wednesday.

Finland's Minister of Social Affairs and Health Aino-Kaisa Pekonen holds a news conference on the family leave reform in Helsinki, Finland February 5, 2020. Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen via REUTERS

Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months, in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent. Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth.

Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the “radical reform” was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.

“This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families,” she said.

The number of newborns in Finland fell by around a fifth between 2010 and 2018, to just 47,577 babies in a country of around 5.5 million people. Pekonen said other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers.

Finland’s coalition of five parties, all led by women of whom four are under 35 years old, took office in December and has made gender equality a priority.

Speaking at the 50th annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin called for states and companies to do more to ensure women were treated fairly, saying gender equality “doesn’t happen by itself”.

A previous centre-right Finnish government attempted to reform parental leave in 2018 but eventually rejected the idea as too costly.

Pekonen said a more equal distribution of domestic workload between parents has been proven to diminish the risk of divorce.

“Over a longer term, it also improves equality in working life and in wages by directing fathers to use a larger proportion of parental leaves than before,” she said.",https://in.reuters.com/article/finland-politics/finland-to-offer-new-fathers-as-much-paid-leave-as-mothers-idINKBN1ZZ1NK
Rising from the rubble: London pub rebuilt brick by brick after illegal bulldozing,"This London pub was illegally demolished in 2015 by greedy developers who wanted the land. They had hoped to get away with a manageable fine but instead were ordered to rebuild it exactly as it was, brick by brick. It’s due to reopen next month.",1,"Standing next to the rubble of the Carlton Tavern, its patrons thought that this was just another brazen example of developers skirting the law to turn their pub into profit.

Bulldozers had sheared away the wall of the 1920s west London pub, with its distinctive tiled signage, to reveal the fully stocked bar and darts trophies still on display.

But the Carlton’s story did not follow the usual plot, where the developer presents the fait accompli to the local authority and pays a fine before pressing ahead with the redevelopment and counting their profits.

Instead, after a dogged six-year campaign by locals, the Carlton Tavern will reopen next month – lockdown permitting – after the developers were ordered to rebuild the pub “brick by brick”, a ruling that pub campaigners say has set an extraordinary precedent.

“People said it was impossible,” said Polly Robertson, a leading member of the Rebuild the Carlton Tavern campaign. “Many people said, ‘Polly, it’s not worth it, nothing’s going to happen’. And I just thought, no – I’m not going to let it lie.”

The reopening comes on 12 April, the day that Covid-19 restrictions are due to be lifted in England to let pubs and restaurants serve drinks and meals outdoors. It is a day that will be celebrated by England’s 33,305 pubs, but by none more keenly than at the Carlton in Maida Vale.

The Carlton Tavern’s last orders were in April 2015. After being denied planning permission to convert it into 10 flats, and two days before Historic England was due to recommend the pub be granted Grade-II listed status, the owners ordered its demolition.

Robertson and 5,300 other locals, including several local councillors, mobilised to persuade Westminster council to act.

It ordered the owners, CTLX, to rebuild the Carlton brick by brick. A planning inquiry the following year confirmed the decision, ruling that the pub should be rebuilt “in facsimile”, from the red bricks to the distinctive tiled pub name.

“They said it would be too difficult to do, but we had an answer for that,” Robertson said. “We had a suspicion before the demolition that they would do something, so we asked Historic England to think about listing it. They took a plaster cast of every tile, they took pictures and documented everything.”

With nowhere left to turn, the developers started the rebuild. “And to be fair to [CTLX], they have done amazing work,” Robertson said. “It looks fantastic.”

Although praise for the demolishers goes only so far. “I doubt they will be [at the reopening]. The community would eat them alive,” she said.

The Carlton Tavern’s wooden doors, fittings and tiled signs are remarkably similar to photographs taken before 2015. The new leaseholders are Tom Rees and Ben Martin, who set up Homegrown Pubs last year, and they are still putting the finishing touches to the fit-out.

“Lots of parts of the bar and the fireplace, the bannister, have been reclaimed from the rubble,” Rees said. “The pub tells its story from the half-broken fixtures that we’ve got. You can see bits of broken wood – it’s not all perfect, which we really love because it gives character and charm to the building.”

Rees and Martin have restored the cellar, which will be stocked by local London brewers including the Camden Town Brewery, Five Points from Hackney, the London Brewing Co, and Anspach & Hobday.

“Ben and I have been running pubs and restaurants for a long time, and we decided to set up our company,” Rees said. “I live locally and I knew about the pub. This has happened multiple times in different places and there’s never been a result like this.

“From the outside, it seems like a totally mad thing to do – setting up a pub company during the middle of the pandemic. But, from the inside, landlords have had the upper hand with leaseholders for ever, so this was an opportunity to level the playing field across the industry.”

The new Carlton will focus more on food, although Rees fights shy of the word “gastropub”.

“We want it to be a great little boozer where you can come and have some pints of cask any day of the week, but we’ll also have a nice dining area out the back. We hope we can be everything to everyone.”

James Watson, the pub protection adviser for the Campaign for Pubs, advised the Carlton campaign. “I never imagined that I would see a planning inspector order a developer to put back what he’d just knocked down, to look exactly as it was. I thought the developer would get a slap on the wrist, a £6,000 fine. But I was flabbergasted – and it has set an incredibly useful precedent. Other planning inspectors will remember it, and so will developers.”

Watson was involved in campaigning for legislation in 2017 that went some way to stopping pubs from being converted into shops under permitted development rules – full planning permission is now required.

“Most developers tend to be slightly smarter than sending in the bulldozers,” he said. “The age-old trick is to take some tiles off the roof and let the rain in. The beams rot, it collapses and they say to the council, ‘This is a derelict site that needs to be rebuilt as flats.’”

Councils in Cambridge and London are questioning this method more and more, Watson said. “They’re challenging these Trojan horse attacks on pubs, where they say they’re going to put a bike shed in the basement and a gym upstairs and, suddenly, your pub space is just a lock-up.

“We need other councils around the country to do the same,” he said. “Planning officers need to be wise to these tricks.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/21/rising-from-the-rubble-london-pub-rebuilt-brick-by-brick-after-bulldozing
Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year,Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year,1,"Aldi has increased its hourly rates of pay for staff after breaking the £12bn sales barrier for the first time.

Last year Aldi reported record earnings in the UK and Ireland against a increasingly fragile retail sector. It also enjoyed a strong Christmas.

The German discounter has again touted itself as the UK’s best-paying supermarket after it increased wages for all employees.

The company said all store assistants will from February earn £9.10 per hour outside the M25, and £10.55 in London. Interestingly, Aldi said all workers are paid the same flat rate, however old they are.

Employees previously earned £8.85 per hour and £10.20 per hour respectively.

Real living wage

Regionally, Aldi’s pay exceeds the UK’s “real living wage”, which is encouraged by the Living Wage Foundation and is more than the Government’s statutory boundaries. Many feel the Government’s rates are too low.

In London, the supermarket’s new £10.55 wage matches the charity’s voluntary minimum. Aldi also told i that store managers start on £44,890, which is almost £20,000 more than a junior doctor’s starting salary, and more than double that of a police officer beginning their career.

While Aldi’s rates of pay are notable, it’s worth pointing out that the company employs fewer members of staff per store than traditional supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Aldi has around 40 members of staff in each shop, while rivals require far more – usually more than double.

The budget chain is able to make do with fewer workers thanks to its more efficient operating system – shelves don’t need stacking because food products are put up still in boxes, for example, and checkouts run quicker as customers bag their own groceries. There are numerous other cost-saving mechanisms.

Tesco launched its discount spin-off Jack’s based on a similar model touting speed and simplicity. Jack’s also functions with fewer team members than classic Tesco branches. Staff pay at Jack’s is £9 per hour – 10p less than Aldi.

New store plans

Aldi’s pay rise comes as high street stores continue to struggle. At Waitrose, staff – or “partners” as they are known – are given a yearly bonus in addition to their wages, but this year they may not get one for the first time since 1953.



Giles Hurley, CEO for Aldi UK, said: “Our store colleagues do a fantastic job every day and the excellent service they provide to customers is a key reason why we are the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket.

“We’re committed to being the best supermarket employer in Britain and this means rewarding our colleagues for the excellent job they do with market-leading rates of pay and opportunities to progress their career at Aldi.”

Aldi now has more than 800 stores across the UK and plans to open a further 65 in 2019. The company said it will be creating around 2,500 new jobs in the process.

The German chain wants to have 1,200 branches in the UK by the end of 2025. Morrisons and co. must be worried.",https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/aldi-wages-higher-living-wage-profit-increase-results/
DEA finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research-grade cannabis,"Good news! The DEA quietly announced ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes. And that means American researchers can, for the first time ever, conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC they’ve been forced to use for decades....",1,"Politics DEA finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research-grade cannabis Bruce Kennedy May 18, 2021 For decades, American researchers have been forced to use only poor-quality, low-THC cannabis grown by a Mississippi contractor. Now the DEA is allowing others, who know how to grow good cannabis, to supply research-grade weed to scientists. (AdobeStock)

Late last week, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) quietly made an announcement that’s expected to have a profound and long-lasting impact on cannabis research and development in the United States.

In its statement, the DEA said it was “nearing the end of its review of certain marijuana grower applications, thereby allowing it to soon register additional entities authorized to produce marijuana for research purposes.”

In other words, the feds are ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes. And that means American researchers can, for the first time ever, conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC schwag they’ve been forced to use for decades.

NIDA monopoly since 1968

There are several reasons why this is a big deal. Since 1968, the only federally approved supplier of cannabis for research purposes in the United States has been a 12-acre farm run by the National Center for the Development of Natural Products at the University of Mississippi. That production has been exclusively for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which maintains control over the production and distribution of research-grade cannabis in the United States.

Over the years, the Mississippi weed farm has earned a notorious reputation for growing some of the worst cannabis in the world. Leafly’s Ben Adlin documented the shockingly poor quality in this 2017 article:

Smoking 25% THC, studying 8% THC

The poor quality and low potency of the government-grown cannabis has been an ongoing issue for U.S. cannabis researchers.

The inadequacy of NIDA cannabis has led to some high-profile academic disputes, lawsuits and national headlines, as well as well-founded accusations that the DEA was dragging its feet on the issue. In 2017 Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) declared that NIDA was “completely inadequate as a source of marijuana for drug development research.”

For years, NIDA and the DEA have promised to open up the sourcing of federally-approved research cannabis. But nothing happened.

Related Wasn’t the DEA going to let others grow research-grade cannabis?

DEA finally relents

On May 14, however, the DEA announced that “a number of manufacturers’ applications to cultivate marijuana for research needs in the United States appears to be consistent with applicable legal standards and relevant laws.”

As a result, and pending final approval, the agency has given preliminary approval to several organizations to grow cannabis for research.

At the moment only three organizations have been publicly named as approved new growers for research: Pennsylvania-based Groff North America, the Scottsdale Research Institute (SRI) in Arizona, and Biopharmaceutical Research Company (BRC) in California.

‘Monumental step’

For George Hodgin, a former Navy SEAL who is the founder and CEO of BRC, the DEA’s announcement is nothing but good news.

“Up until now, research institutions, biotech firms and other private companies had few, if any, options for federally legal cannabis R&D,” he said in an email to Leafly. “This monumental step from the DEA means that BRC can now position itself as that all-in-one source for reliable and safe research and cultivation.”

Hodgin noted that companies like his also want research organizations to have more choices in the marketplace; ensuring that “the quality of the product is comparable to the supply used by cannabis patients as well as recreational users.”

The DEA announcement, he added, will “unleash a new wave of job creation in the cannabis sector and at the same time begin to develop valuable American IP [intellectual property]. This just wasn’t really possible before this decision.”

Real-world cannabis finally available

For Matthew Zorn, a Houston-based attorney, the DEA’s decision is historic. Zorn was the co-lead lawyer in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit, “Scottsdale Research v. DOJ/DEA,” filed last year. As a result of that lawsuit, filed on behalf of SRI, the Department of Justice released a previously confidential memo from 2018 that concluded the DEA’s long-standing policy on marijuana research violated federal law, as well as U.S. treaty obligations.

SRI has made cannabis research headlines for years now, most recently for groundbreaking studies administered by Sue Sisley, a medical doctor who conducted clinic trials with military veterans to determine if cannabis is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for managing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and pain.

With the DEA announcement, Zorn told Leafly, “scientists will be able to clinically study the types of cannabis that are being used, with real-world cannabis. A lot of people may not appreciate the importance of that, with [national cannabis] legalization around the corner. We don’t know when, but the need for this research is urgent. We can as quickly as possible start growing and have a supply for researchers to get good data.”

Breaking down barriers to research

The promise to end NIDA’s cannabis monopoly, Zorn noted, is the first step towards addressing the longstanding argument by cannabis legalization opponents, that there’s no rigorous data in the U.S. that has shown the medicinal benefits of cannabis.

“Everything’s been limited to observational studies,” he said, “and it’s true clinical studies have taken place overseas. But the biggest criticism right now against medicinal marijuana and marijuana legalization more generally is that there isn’t enough data and research. That is directly traceable to this NIDA monopoly. And now, hopefully, we’re going to get answers.”

Fueling innovation in the cannabis sector

For his part BRC’s George Hodgin sees the start of a new era of cannabis research and development, fueled in part by a new players in the marketplace.

“Now there’s competition, which this space has needed so badly for such a long time,” he said. “We’re ready to compete, that’s what we’ve been waiting for years to do. The decision to issue these licenses, in my view, will lead to an incredible rush of innovation in the healthcare space.”

But according to Hodgin, these developments will depend on more than rapid change. “Quality is just as important,” he said. “You can have the best research institutions in the world researching cannabis, but if the quality of the samples does not match what is actually in use, the research isn’t all that helpful. So, I think the competition will increase the speed, there’s not a doubt about that, but I also think the quality is going to be a crucial part of driving the innovation as well.”

Farmer spends 16 years studying law by himself to sue firm,Farmer spends 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a powerful chemical firm for 'polluting his land' - and he wins the first round,1,"Wang Enlin, who has just three years of education, has won the first instance of a high-profile case in China

A Chinese farmer has spent 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a chemical company for allegedly polluting his land.

Wang Enlin, who had just three years of education, has won the first instance in a high-profile case against state-owned Qihua Group, reported the People's Daily Online.

Although Qihua Group, whose assets exceed two billion yuan (£233 million), has appealed against the decision, the elderly man said he is determined to seek justice for himself and his neighbours who could no longer grow healthy crops on their contaminated land.

Mr Wang, who is in his 60s, lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar in the Heilongjiang Province, according to People's Daily Online, which cited China Youth Daily.

The man said he would forever remember the year of 2001 when his land was flooded by the toxic waste discharged by Qihua Group.

It was the eve of the Lunar New Year, and Mr Wang was playing cards and making dumplings with his neighbours. All of sudden, they realised that the house they were in was flooded by the wastewater from the nearby Qihua factory.

The wastewater also flooded part of the farmland in the village.

According to the report, a government document from 2001 claimed that the affected farmland 'can not be used for a long time' due to the pollution.

Between 2001 to 2016, it has been suggested that Qihua continued to dump hazardous waste into the village, whose residents rely upon agriculture for a living.

The company produced polyvinyl chloride and released 15,000 to 20,000 tons of chemical waste every year, the report said.

Qihua has also reportedly created a 71-acre wasteland with calcium carbide residue and a 478-acre pond with its liquid waste.

A picture released by People's Daily Online shows that the Qihua Group has dumped 71 acres of calcium carbide residue in the village of Yushutun, where Mr Wang lives

In 2001, Mr Wang wrote a letter to the Land Resources Bureau of Qiqihar to complain about the pollution Qihua had brought to his village.

He said while dealing with the local officials, he was repeatedly asked to produce evidence to prove that the village's land had been polluted.

Mr Wang told a reporter: 'I knew I was in the right, but I did not know what law the other party had broken or whether or not there was evidence.' He received the interview in his small home which he spent 50 yuan (£5.8) per month renting from the village's authority.

As a result, Mr Wang decided to study law by himself, an endeavour he would carry on pursuing for the next 16 years.

The farmer, who had dropped out of primary school at the third grade, started reading through a dozen law books with the help of a dictionary.

At the time, he did not have money to buy the books, so he spent day after day reading the books at the local book store and copying the relevant information by hand, according to the man. In return, he would give bags of free corn to the shopkeeper for letting him stay there.

Not only that, he also used the legal knowledge he had learnt to help his neighbours gather evidence. Their farms had also been polluted by Qihua Group, said Mr Wang.

Mr Wang, who is in his 60s, lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar (pictured)

In 2007, a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.

However due to unspecified complications, the court only began processing Mr Wang and his neighbours' case in 2015 - eight years after the original petition had been made, People's Daily Online reported.

Thanks to the evidence Mr Wang had gathered in the 16 years, Mr Wang and his neighbours apparently won the first instance.

The Angangxi District Court of Qiqihar ruled that the families in Yushutun village would receive financial compensation from Qihua Group amounting 820,000 yuan (£96,000). The date of the first instance was not revealed in the report.

Qihua Group has appealed against the court's decision. The case is being processed at the Angangxi District Court as of writing.

A determined Mr Wang told the reporter: 'We will certainly win. Even if we lose, we will continue to battle.'",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-4189350/Farmer-spends-16-years-studying-law-sue-firm.html
Britney Spears officially petitions for dad Jamie Spears to resign as her conservator,Britney Spears officially petitions for dad Jamie Spears to resign as her conservator,1,"Britney Spears, said by her lawyers to be chafing under the 12-year guardianship of her father, has filed an official petition seeking to have him removed as her conservator.

According to documents filed Tuesday in probate court in Los Angeles, the pop star requested the resignation of James ""Jamie"" Spears as her personal conservator.

She seeks to replace him with Jodi Montgomery, a state-appointed conservator who has temporarily acted as her personal conservator since her father relinquished the role in September 2019 amid health issues.

Britney Spears also reserved the right to petition for the permanent termination of her conservatorship under the state Probate Code.

In an attachment, her lawyer sought to ensure that Montgomery would have the power to make medical decisions, communicate with her doctors and have access to her medical records. She also would be able to limit Britney's visitors with the exception of her lawyer, retain caretakers and security guards on a 24/7 basis, and prosecute civil harassment restraining orders deemed appropriate.

The petition does not make clear whether Britney Spears intends for Jamie Spears to retain his other role as conservator of her finances. His lawyers have argued to the probate court hearing the case that he has greatly improved her financial estate, now worth around $60 million.

But a separate document in the court file shows that Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust, his co-conservator of her finances, will have the power to access all documents and records relating to her assets, and to take actions necessary to secure them, in addition to a host of other powers typically wielded by financial managers.

The petition to remove Jamie Spears may be a direct result of what his lawyer, Vivian Thoreen, said publicly last month in response to criticism on social media and in a new documentary about his daughter's long conservatorship.

She said fans who accuse Jamie Spears of mistreating his daughter have it ""so wrong.""

""(Jamie) would love nothing more than to see Britney not need a conservatorship,"" Thoreen told CNN on Feb. 25. ""Whether or not there is an end to the conservatorship really depends on Britney. If she wants to end her conservatorship, she can file a petition to end it.""

After public sentiment began building for the #FreeBritney movement, and attacks on Jamie Spears mounted, Thoreen tried to advocate on behalf of her client.

""Jamie is not suggesting that he is the perfect dad or that he would receive any 'Father of the Year' award. Like any parent, he doesn't always see eye-to-eye on what Britney may want,"" she told CNN. ""But Jamie believes every single decision he has made has been in her best interest.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Thoreen for comment. Britney's lawyer, Samuel Ingham, declined comment.

Britney Spears, 39, has been under a state conservatorship, as guardianship is called in California, since the end of 2008, following a mental-health breakdown. Her father, 68, has been either a co-conservator or sole conservator during most of the period she has been under supervision of the probate court.

Until recently, she continued her climb as a pop superstar, becoming a multimillionaire with a string of platinum-selling records, taking a gig as a ""X Factor"" judge and becoming the reigning queen of Las Vegas residencies.

By the start of 2019, when she abruptly suspended her Las Vegas show because of her father's health issues, fans began demanding to know why she still needed a guardian looking after her.

In 2020, Britney Spears's lawyers began attempting to get her father removed as her conservator, saying she was ""strongly opposed"" to him remaining in the role.

In November, her lawyer told the court she no longer wanted her father involved in her care, that she is ""afraid"" of him and would refuse to perform if he remained in charge.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/03/25/britney-spears-petitions-dad-jamie-spears-resign-her-conservator/7004610002/
Golden Dawn guilty verdicts celebrated across Greece,"The Greek Neo-Nazi party, which was in the parliament from ~2012 to ~2019, is now declared a criminal organization",1,"A court verdict in Athens with ramifications for the far right across Europe has been met with jubilation in Greece and internationally after judges ruled the neo-fascist Golden Dawn was a criminal organisation in disguise.

Tens of thousands of people who had converged near the heavily guarded court complex in Athens in anticipation of the judgment roared in excitement as the news emerged. Many broke into spontaneous applause and punched the air as it became clear that the three-member tribunal had found the far-right group guilty of operating a gang of hit squads bent on eliminating perceived enemies.

“It’s official. Golden Dawn is over. The conviction is overwhelming,” said Petros Constantinou, a leading anti-racism activist. “The mood here today is resonant of the celebrations we saw with the liberation of Athens from the Nazis. It’s a great day.”

Wrapping up a trial that began in April 2015, the presiding judge, Maria Lepenioti, said the court had concluded that seven of Golden Dawn’s 18 former MPs, including the party founder, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had led the deadly organisation. The rest were found culpable of participating in the gang.

00:40 Greek court's ruling on Golden Dawn party met with jubilation – video

The verdict was met with widespread relief. Magda Fyssa, whose son Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, was stabbed to death by a senior party operative, and who attended almost every court session over the past five and half years, screamed with emotion. “Pavlos did it! My son,” she wailed outside the courtroom.

The Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, said the judgment was an important day for democracy and evidence that Greek institutions were able to “fend off any attempt to undermine them.”

Before the verdict, the public prosecutor overseeing the case recommended the acquittal of many key party members in relation to the criminal organisation charge, citing lack of evidence – a recommendation that was roundly denounced by critics, who accused the magistrate of typifying the toxic influence wielded by conservatives over the justice system.

The hearing was the biggest trial of fascists since the prosecution of the Nazis at Nuremberg after the second world war.

Two thousand police officers, many brought in as backup from the countryside amid fears of violent clashes between the protesters and far-right supporters, surrounded the area near the court as helicopters and drones flew overhead. Clashes did break out as rocks and molotov cocktails were hurled at police, who responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence was attributed to a minority of anti-establishment forces.

The leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who was in the crowd, said that after years of sowing hate, poisoning Greek society and orchestrating murderous attacks, Golden Dawn fanatics would finally face justice.

“They are not innocent. We all know that,” he wrote on social media before the three-member tribunal’s decision. “On Wednesday we ought to be there to shout it loud and clear. We owe it to the history of this country, we owe it to democracy, we owe it to our children.”

Those charged with directing the criminal organisation face sentences of up to 15 years in prison. If found guilty of additional crimes, the sentences handed down by the criminal court are likely to be longer, although justice officials said it may take several days of legal proceedings before they are formally announced.

The accused vigorously denied the charges, claiming they were victims of political persecution. Michaloliakos, 62, a Holocaust denier and ardent admirer of Hitler whose neofascist beliefs began to take form during Greece’s 1967-74 military dictatorship, has described Golden Dawn as a patriotic party of ultra-nationalists. Diehards lower down the chain who have been linked to violent attacks have been disavowed by the leader.

Golden Dawn stood broadly accused of targeting immigrants, communist trade unionists, anti-fascists, leftists and gay people, culminating in the fatal stabbing of Fyssas, whose murder in September 2013 forced Greek authorities to act. A senior operative in the party, Giorgos Roupakios, confessed to killing the rapper.

Judges sitting in the court of appeals focused on specific cases including whether the group was culpable of the attempted murder of Abouzid Embarak and three other Egyptian fishermen in June 2012.

Golden Dawn members have already been found guilty of the killing of a Pakistani fruit worker, Ssazad Lukman, in Athens in January 2013.

The court examined evidence that ranged from the testimonies of victims and five former Golden Dawn members now in witness protection programmes to incriminating videos snatched from the homes of party leaders, and heard that the attacks increased in frequency after the party’s entry into the Greek parliament in 2012.

At the height of Greece’s debilitating debt crisis, Golden Dawn, riding a tidal wave of popular anger with EU-mandated austerity measures, won 21 seats in the 300-member house to become the country’s third biggest political force.

In the last general election, in July last year, the neo-Nazis narrowly failed to win enough votes to win any seats in parliament, and the party has all but collapsed amid infighting and defections since then.

“The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,” said Nils Muižnieks, the Europe director of Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.”

The central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (Kise) said the “historic verdict ... delegitimises the neo-Nazi organisations and at the same time fortifies democracy in the country”.

But it said this was no time “to let our guard down”. A Jewish cemetery in Athens was vandalised in an attack attributed to the extremists on Monday and its walls daubed with slogans used by the Third Reich.

Pentagon issues de facto ban on Confederate flag at military bases,Pentagon issues de facto ban on Confederate flag at military bases,1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Mark Esper has issued a policy ushering in a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag at U.S. military installations around the world by authorizing only certain flags that promote unity, according to a copy of his memo, seen by Reuters on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley are seen during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on 'Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement' in Washington, DC, U.S. July 9, 2020.

The decision could increase tension between Esper and Republican President Donald Trump, who has cited free speech rights in his defense of Americans who fly the Confederate flag.

“The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols,” Esper said in the memo.

The Confederate flag was flown by breakaway Southern states that advocated for the continuation of slavery and lost the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War. Flying the flag can be offensive to many Americans, who see it as a reminder of the enslavement of Black Americans and as a symbol of white supremacy.

Supporters say the flag represents the South’s heritage and culture and, along with U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals and statues honoring them, serve as memorials to Confederate casualties in the Civil War.

Trump, who has been accused of intentionally stoking racial tensions as part of his re-election campaign, has criticized the desecration and removal of statues of Confederate and other former U.S. leaders to energize his political base

Trump has also publicly opposed renaming U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals, such as Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Bragg in North Carolina, putting him at odds with his military, whose top general has said the matter should be re-examined.

A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House was aware of Esper’s memo.

Esper also clashed with Trump last month by publicly opposing the deployment of active-duty troops to address civil unrest across the country following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

Beyond the American flag, Esper’s memorandum cites a series of flags that can be flown on military installations, including state flags and ones to honor prisoners of war and service members who went missing in action.

The reason it does not cite the Confederate flag explicitly was to ensure that it could withstand challenges, the defense official said.

“The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges,” the official said.

Most U.S. military services, including the Marine Corps, have already banned the display of Confederate flags, but Esper’s memorandum is department-wide and will affect military installations around the world.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-pentagon/pentagon-issues-de-facto-ban-on-confederate-flag-at-military-bases-idUSKCN24I23K
Donors give computers to Ghana school where teacher taught computer tech on a blackboard,Ghanaian teacher who Taught his Students How to use mS word on a blackboard gets computers donated to his school,1,"(CNN) With just a blackboard and a talent for drawing, a Ghanaian teacher has explained in detail to his students the secrets of Microsoft Word, earning numerous headlines and worldwide admiration.

Now Richard Appiah Akoto, who gained fame last month for teaching computer technology without computers at Betenase M/A Junior High School in the southern Ghana town of Sekyedumase, is starting to appreciate the fruits of his unexpected media attention.

People and organizations are donating desktop computers and laptops to his school. And, as part of Microsoft's promise to offer him free training, Akoto was flown to Singapore to attend the annual Microsoft Educators Exchange.

Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide education for Microsoft, meets with Richard Appiah Akoto.

The tech giant had pledged to equip Akoto with a device from a business partner as well as access to the Microsoft Certified Educator Program (MCE) for professional development.

'Knowledge is crucial'

After reading the Facebook post that made Akoto famous, a Saudi benefactor at University of Leeds in the UK sent him a laptop ""as a small gift to his students.""

""I always understand from the teachings of Islam that useful knowledge is crucial for the benefit of the self and humanity,"" Amirah Alharthi, a PhD student in Leeds' department of statistics, told CNN.

""Also, I am thinking of how much genius people the world has already lost because these people did not have the fair opportunities comparing to others and that makes me very sad.""

Betenase M/A Junior High School hasn't had a computer since 2011, and Akoto's students need to pass a national exam that includes questions on information and communication technology (ICT).

The written exam is a requisite for 14- and 15-year-olds in Ghana to progress to high school.

Five desktops and a laptop

But Alharthi's gift wasn't the only one.

Inspired by the teacher's story, NIIT Ghana, a computer training school based in Accra, donated five desktop computers to the school, along with books and a laptop for Akoto.

NIIT's center manager, Ashish Kumar, told CNN he saw the teacher's photos going viral on Facebook and CNN as well as other media organizations.

""We were so touched by the teacher's dedication for his students that we decided to support the school with the best we can do,"" he said. ""We took (a) printout of the news, pasted on our notice board and shared it with our CEO, Kapil Gupta.""

The company's senior management, including business head Yaw Amoateng and senior manager Sanjeev Mishra, traveled to Sekyedumase to present the equipment to the class.

Mom with 'gut feeling' stops school shooter before planned attack,Mom with 'gut feeling' stops school shooter before planned attack,1,"A suspicious mom who followed her instincts helped prevent a mass school shooting.

On Wednesday, Koeberle Bull of Lumberton, N.J., woke up to a racist message on Facebook from a man in Kentucky. “It was really vulgar — he called my kids the N-word and hoped terrible things for them,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The mom of three biracial children, ages 16, 11, and 8, was especially concerned about the man’s profile picture in which he showed off a gun, so, going on a “gut feeling,” she called her local police station and filed a report. “But I felt like it wouldn’t really go anywhere, so I posted a screenshot of the message on Facebook,” she says.

The man had blocked Bull. However, her friends dug around for details about his identity, and Bull soon had enough information to share with the police in Lawrenceburg, Ky. “I spoke to Officer Josh Satterly, who told me, ‘There’s no room for this kind of hate in my world,” she says. “He took me seriously.”

Local and state police followed the mom’s tip, and on Thursday, officers drove to the home of a 20-year-old man named Dylan Jarrell, just as he was leaving his house with more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a firearm, a 100-round high-capacity magazine, and a “detailed plan of attack.” He was headed toward two school districts in Anderson County and Shelby County, the Kentucky State Police said in a press conference Friday.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that as a result of this investigation, we saved lives,” Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said during the press conference. “This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc.

“He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary. And the only thing that stood between him and evil … is law enforcement,” he added.

When police searched Jarrell’s home, they found an internet search history on “How to conduct a school shooting” and a “credible and imminent threat to Shelby and Anderson County schools,” according to a press release. Police also revealed that in May, Jarrell had been questioned by the FBI regarding social media threats toward a Tennessee school.

Story continues

Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications and is being held in the Shelby County Detention Center.

Sheila Mitchell of Anderson County Public Schools tells Yahoo Lifestyle that classes were closed on Friday due to concern for student safety. “I commend [Bull] for her courage and willingness to follow through on the threat and the collaborative efforts of local and state law enforcement. We’re very blessed and grateful.”

Bull has received grateful invitations to visit families from all over the country and says the timing of the arrest was “divine intervention.”

She also encourages people to report social media messages of concern. “That one-in-a-million call could prevent a tragedy,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I’m thankful everyone is OK.”

He said he still has a job, so he paid it forward. He immediately donated $300 to the Atlanta Community Food Bank.

Janette Maas, a 61-year-old retired airline pilot, had finished her weekly shopping at a Maretta Kroger during the 7 a.m. seniors-only hour Wednesday and thought something was amiss because the self check-out lanes were closed. The cashier told her an anonymous donor had covered her $60 in groceries, and her receipt said ""Atlanta Angel."" ""I got my Kroger fuel points,"" she said.

She later heard Perry was the donor, and said she was thinking of finding a Madea movie to watch later as thanks.

How much money Perry will end up shelling out is unclear, but it could be well in the six figures.

Perry over the weekend gave $21,000 —$500 each —

for 42 out-of-work servers at his favorite Houston’s restaurant off Northside Parkway near I-75.

Pakistan’s virus-idled workers hired to plant trees,"Pakistan begins colossal tree planting campaign - a staggering 10 billion trees will be planted starting now in order to combat climate change using 60,000 workers who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus",1,"Officials say move will create more than 60,000 jobs as gov’t aims to help those who lost jobs due to COVID-19 lockdown.

When construction worker Abdul Rahman lost his job to Pakistan’s coronavirus lockdown, his choices looked stark – resort to begging on the streets or let his family go hungry.

But the government has now given him a better option: Join tens of thousands of other out-of-work labourers in planting billions of trees across the country to deal with climate change threats.

Since Pakistan locked down on March 23 to try to stem the spread of COVID-19, unemployed day labourers have been given new jobs as “jungle workers”, planting saplings as part of the country’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.

Such “green stimulus” efforts are an example of how funds that aim to help families and keep the economy running during pandemic shutdowns could also help nations prepare for the next big threat: climate change.

“Due to coronavirus, all the cities have shut down and there is no work. Most of us daily wagers couldn’t earn a living,” Rahman, a resident of Rawalpindi district in Punjab province, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

He now makes 500 rupees ($3) a day planting trees – about half of what he might have made on a good day, but enough to get by.

“All of us now have a way of earning daily wages again to feed our families,” he said.

The ambitious five-year tree-planting programme, which Prime Minister Imran Khan launched in 2018, aims to counter rising temperatures, flooding, droughts and other extreme weather conditions in the country that scientists link to climate change.

Big risks

The Global Climate Risk Index 2020, issued by think-tank Germanwatch, ranked Pakistan fifth on a list of countries most affected by planetary heating over the last 20 years – even though the South Asian nation contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gases.

As the coronavirus pandemic struck Pakistan, the 10 Billion Trees campaign was initially halted as part of social distancing orders put in place to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 14,880 people in Pakistan, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

But earlier this month, the prime minister granted an exemption to allow the forestry agency to restart the programme and create more than 63,600 jobs, according to government officials.

A recent assessment by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics found that, due to the lockdown, up to 19 million people could be laid off, almost 70 perfect of them in the Punjab province.

Abdul Muqeet Khan, chief conservator of forests for Rawalpindi district, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the planting project is in “full swing”.

Much of the work is happening on 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land near the capital Islamabad, he said, as well as on other tracts of state-owned forest land around the country.

This year, the programme is employing triple the number of workers it did in its first year, said Malik Amin Aslam, climate change adviser to the prime minister.

Many of the new jobs are being created in rural areas, he said, with a focus on hiring women and unemployed daily workers – mainly young people – who were migrating home from locked-down cities.

The work, which pays between 500-800 rupees ($3-5) a day, includes setting up nurseries, planting saplings, and serving as forest protection guards or forest firefighters, he said.

All the workers have been told to wear masks and maintain the mandated two metres (six feet) of social distance between them, he added.

“This tragic crisis provided an opportunity and we grabbed it,” Aslam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.

“Nurturing nature has come to the economic rescue of thousands of people.”

Extended help

According to Germanwatch, Pakistan reported more than 150 extreme weather events between 1999 and 2018 – from floods to heatwaves – with total losses of $3.8bn.

Environmentalists have long pushed reforestation as a way to help, saying forests help prevent flooding, stabilise rainfall, provide cool spaces, absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions and protect biodiversity.

According to green group WWF, Pakistan is a “forest poor” country where trees cover less than 6 percent of the total area.

With 7.5 billion rupees ($46m) in funding, the 10 Billion Trees project aims to scale up the success of an earlier Billion Tree Tsunami in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the government has been planting trees since 2014.

200414082202927

About 30 million Indigenous saplings have been planted in Punjab since the start of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami – including mulberry, acacia and moringa – said Shahid Rashid Awan, project director for Punjab province.

This year, the project hopes to hit 50 million trees, he said.

Planting season usually ends in May, Awan noted, but programme organisers plan to extend the initiative to the end of June, to keep workers employed for longer.

“We can absorb all the unemployed labourers and workers who have fled the cities and returned to their villages in the past few weeks. This is unskilled work,” he said.

Recovering with dignity

Rab Nawaz, of WWF-Pakistan, said the government’s move is “a very good idea to create green jobs and get people employed”.

But he cautioned that planting trees is just one tool in the fight against climate change, saying there also needed to be an investment in improving the ability of farmers and city dwellers to adapt to the effects of a hotter planet.

“The government should be very selective on how it spends money, and focus on resilience,” he urged.

For Aslam, the green jobs initiative is a way to help Pakistan’s workers recover from the coronavirus crisis “with dignity and avoiding handouts”.

“This has taught us the valuable lesson that when you invest in nature it not only pays you back, but also rescues you in a stressed economic situation,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/pakistan-virus-idled-workers-hired-plant-trees-200429070109237.html

Pope Francis to parents of L.G.B.T. children: ‘God loves your children as they are.’,Pope Francis to parents of L.G.B.T. children: ‘God loves your children as they are.’,1,"Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” He did so in a brief encounter with some 40 Italian parents (both mothers and fathers) of L.G.B.T. children after the public audience in the Renaissance courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican.

The parents are members of an Italian association, Tenda di Gionata (“Jonathan’s Tent”), which welcomes and provides information and formation to L.G.B.T. Christians, their families and pastoral workers. The association was founded in 2018 by people inspired by a Catholic priest, the late Rev. David Esposito from the Diocese of Fermo in the Marches region of Italy.

Mara Grassi, the vice president of the association, together with her husband Agostino Usai—both wearing masks—presented the pope with a booklet titled “Genitori Fortunati” (“Fortunate Parents”) that documented the experiences of these parents with the church, experiences that were at times far from easy, and their requests for acceptance despite all too often being considered “undesirable” by church communities. (An English-language version will soon be published)

Mara Grassi told Pope Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Speaking afterward to Avvenire, the daily paper of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, Ms. Grassi said she told the pope that “our association aims to foster dialogue between the church and the families of L.G.B.T. [people].” Taking her cue from the booklet’s title, she confided to him, “We consider ourselves fortunate because we had to change the way that we had always looked at our children. We found a new way of looking that enabled us to see in them the beauty and love of God.”

According to her account of the conversation, she told Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Having listened carefully to what she said, Pope Francis reassured her, “The church does not exclude them because she loves them deeply.”

As he bade them farewell, the association gave the pope a rainbow-colored T-shirt with the words “In love there is no fear” emblazoned on it.

Speaking to La Repubblica, the Italian daily, after the audience, Ms. Grassi, a Catholic mother of four children—the eldest of whom is a gay person, now aged 40—said she experienced “very strong emotions” in her encounter with Pope Francis.

She revealed that “for many years I was like a blind person. After I came to know that my son was homosexual, I suffered a lot because the rules of the church made me think that he was excluded from the love of God. Nobody helped me.”

Things changed, she said, when she attended a vigil against homophobia at the church of Regina Pacis in Reggio Emilia, a city in northern Italy. There she met other parents, believers like herself, who have children that are gay, and through these parents she met the Rev. Paolo Cugini, who helped her understand that “faith and homosexuality are not in opposition, and that God loves my son as he is.”

She told the pope that she is the mother of a son who is gay and “who left the church because he did not feel accepted in his diversity.” She explained how, thanks to her son, she changed her way of seeing things and like other persons in the same situation, after being “destabilized at first” on learning of her son’s homosexuality, she has come to see that “we are fortunate parents.”

She said the pope, in response, assured her and the other parents present that “God loves our children because they are all children of God.” And when she requested that the church, too, should change its ways so that no one feels excluded, Francis reassured them saying, “The church loves our children as they are.”",https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are
Blood donation breakthrough sees scientists convert all types to O using gut bacteria,"In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives, researchers from the University of British Columbia have figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.",1,"In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives, scientists have found a way to convert all blood types to the universal type that is safe for all patients to receive, by using microbes found in the human gut.

Researchers from the University of British Columbia have figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.

Blood types are differentiated by the kinds of sugar found on the surface of red blood cells. Type O has no sugars. Scientists had realized that some enzymes can remove the sugars from A, B and AB blood cells, turning them into Type O, but they hadn’t found an enzyme that was safe, efficient and economical, until they considered the gut.

The human digestive tract has the same sugars found on blood cells, and bacterial enzymes found in feces strip the sugars from the lining to aid digestion. The scientists were able to isolate the enzyme and use it to strip blood of its sugars in a more efficient way than any other enzyme.

The scientists made the exciting discovery last August, but have just published the results of their research in the journal Nature Microbiology.

North Texas Investor Uses GameStop Gains to Help Sick Children,"Texas investor uses GME gains to buy Nintendo Switches from Gamestop, and donates them to a Children's Hospital.",1,"Amid the Wall Street drama surrounding GameStop and Robinhood, some investors taking part in the GameStop short sale are using their proceeds to do good deeds for others.

One investor, who wished to remain anonymous, delivered 10 Nintendo switches purchased from GameStop locations around the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Medical City Children's Hospital Thursday.

The investor said his efforts were made possible by GME gains.

Wall Street has been rattled this week by an organized campaign by small investors to take on large hedge funds by driving up shares of Grapevine-based GameStop and other struggling retailers.

The campaign started on Reddit and other discussion boards as small investors encouraged each other to buy GameStop stock, forcing the bigger players like hedge funds to cover their bets by buying the stock, increasing the price even further.

The anonymous investor who donated the Nintendo Switches said they made ""a good amount through r/WallStreetBets on this hilarious GME trade"" and felt inspired to give back ""in a way that was equally hilarious.""

Firefighters 'could not find fire' at Notre Dame 23 minutes before blaze,"The Bishop of Paris, in tears, has told the French press that After fear of their destruction, all 3 irreplaceable Rose Windows, considered the greatest medieval artwork still in existence, have survived. They took years to build in the 13th century.",1,"Advertisement

The treasures that survived the devastating Notre Dame inferno have been revealed - with the great organ and several priceless paintings rumoured been destroyed.

Franck Riester, France's culture minister, said on Tuesday that the cathedral's main organ 'seems to be quite affected' by the blaze while the fate of several other artefacts remains unknown.

Firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save.

Mr Riester said the paintings were mostly undamaged but many may have suffered some effects from the smoke.

'The large paintings, at first glance, have not been affected by the fire. But, often in these situations, there is water damage,' Mr. Riester added.

It comes as it was reported officials attending the Notre Dame blaze initially couldn't find any sign of fire despite the alarm being raised 23 minutes before the structure went up in flames.

Paris public prosecutor Rémy Heitz announced on Tuesday that firefighters were called to the world-famous cathedral at 6.20pm CET, almost half an hour before the roof caught fire after a fire alarm was triggered.

But after an initial inspection they said they were unable to find any evidence of fire.

Firefighters remained inside Notre Dame until a second alarm went off at 6.43pm and eventually discovered a fire in the network of wooden beams under the cathedral's roof - but were unable to put it out.

Mr Heitz said this evening: 'What we know at this stage is that there was an initial alarm at 6:20 p.m., followed by a procedure to verify this but no fire as found.

'Then, there was a second alarm at 6:43 p.m. and at that point a fire was detected in the structure.

'The investigation is going to be long and complex,' he added. 'We are in the process of interviewing witnesses.'

A robot fires water from a hose to douse the flames in the cathedral on Monday night

After eventually responding to the blaze, French firefighters were filmed racing into the burning Notre Dame to save the 850-year-old cathedral from destruction.

The fearless rescue team charged into the inferno with huge flames leaping across the church and sparks tumbling from the ceiling after the roof of the Paris landmark caught fire.

Firefighters battled for eight hours to contain the blaze which destroyed the cathedral's roof and spire, but despite fears that the whole building could collapse the stone structure and iconic bell towers remain standing today.

The firefighters' actions - and their quick deployment of a robot to hose down the cathedral - meant that priceless treasures including reputed relics of the Crucifixion and 13th-century stained-glass windows were saved from the blaze.

Today haunting new photos of Notre Dame's interior showed debris strewn across the floor - as experts warned the damage could take decades to repair - while detectives probe the renovation work which may have led to the blaze.

The pictures revealed that a statue of Jesus descending from the cross, positioned on the altar, was preserved among the smouldering rubble after the roof was destroyed by Monday night's fire.

The three 'irreplaceable' Rose Windows, which date to the 13th century and were last night feared to have melted or exploded, were also intact.

Attention has now turned to what may have caused Notre Dame, part of which was being restored in a €150million refurbishment, to fall victim to such a disaster.

The focus of prosecutors is currently on contractors Le Bras Freres, whose owner Julien Le Bras last year boasted his firm's goal was 'to keep as many old items as possible and not to put the building at risk' after they were awarded a €5.7m (£5m, $6.5m) contract as part of the cathedral's restoration project.

Detectives investigating the catastrophic blaze are today interviewing specialist restorers who were carrying out works on the cathedral spire when the inferno broke out.

French police are understood to have launched a criminal inquiry after a 'stray flame' caused fire to engulf the landmark last night, with heroic firefighters battling for eight hours to bring the blaze under control.

The Paris prosecutor's office is probing 'involuntary destruction caused by fire', indicating authorities are treating the blaze as a tragic accident and not arson or terrorism.

'Nothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,' Remy Heitz told reporters outside the Gothic cathedral, adding that the workers employed at the site were being questioned over Monday's blaze.

Fears for the treasures of Notre Dame: Christ's 'crown of thorns' is saved, but fragment of the Cross and nails 'used to crucify Jesus' unaccounted for The fate of many of the Notre Dame's treasures is still unknown after the huge fire which ripped through the 850-year-old cathedral on Monday. Experts are today entering the wreckage of the Paris landmark to find which of the precious artworks and religious relics have been saved. The mayor of Paris said that one of the most irreplaceable items - the crown of thorns reputed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion - was safe last night. But there are fears for the church's 13th-century stained glass windows and its magnificent organ, while the wooden roof and ornate spire have gone. Safe: Crown of thorns One of the cathedral's most precious objects, a relic purported to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ on the cross, was whisked away to a secure facility. Reports in France stated that the chaplain of the Paris fire brigade had gone inside with the firefighters to save the crown. Experts said the irreplaceable item had been kept in a 'very safe place'. Records of the Crown of Thorns existence begin in the sixth century AD, when it is believed to have been kept in Jerusalem by Christians. During the Crusades in 1238, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople gave it to King Louis IX to win his support and try and preserve his crumbling empire. Louis IX brought the crown back to France and was later made a saint. Although the crown itself was saved, a small fragment of the crown had been kept in the spire and is therefore believed to have burned to ashes. Unknown: True Cross and Holy Nails Another of the cathedral's relics is a purported piece of the True Cross - the very instrument on which Jesus was crucified in the first century AD. The collection also includes a nail which is said to be from the cross. It was unclear on Tuesday morning whether these had been saved along with the Crown of Thorns. Safe: Tunic of St Louis A 13th-century linen tunic which is thought to have belonged to King Louis IX - canonised as St Louis - was also made safe, the mayor of Paris said. In his 44-year reign Louis took part in the Crusades and established early principles of justice such as the presumption of innocence. He was proclaimed a saint in 1297 - the only French monarch to receive the honour - and was responsible for acquiring the Crown of Thorns. Safe: North, West and South Rose Windows The magnificent stained-glass artworks in the cathedral date back to the 13th century. There were fears last night that they would melt or explode but the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV today that they were safe. A French journalist at the scene last night said the north window appeared to be safe with no sign of broken glass although firefighters remained concerned. Architecture professor Julio Bermudez said the stained glass windows were 'really irreplaceable'. Advertisement

Some of the firm's 200 specialist employees were working at the site where the fire is thought to have originated, the cathedral's 300ft-tall wooden and lead spire, which collapsed in front of crowds of horrified Parisians at 8pm.

A source close to the inquiry said that many of the restorers had been interviewed overnight, with prosecutors focusing on the equipment used at the 850-year-old cathedral, where light and power sources were limited.

In such circumstances, hordes of cables and wires would have to be attached to dozens of generators, which would then be hoisted high up on to medieval building.

'The fear is that a small fire began in the rood where they were working,' the source added.

'The irony is that the restorers had just begun working on the spire which collapsed along with much of the roof.'

Le Bras Freres is one of the most respected companies of its kind in France, and last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in the east of the country.

The firm had won the €5.7million contract to restore the Notre Dame spire, which was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in 1859.

They were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put 250 tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lift that could move up and down the 300ft spire.

The blaze, which broke out as the last crowds of tourists ended visits at around 7pm, was finally declared to be 'fully extinguished' at about 9.45am this morning.

As the fire raged, brave rescue teams raced to recover what treasures they could from the Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artefacts and relics of huge religious and international significance.

Among them was the reputed Crown of Thorns, supposedly worn by Jesus during his crucifixion, which was carried to safety by a human chain of emergency service workers.

Today the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV that the three beautiful rose windows on the north, west and south sides of the church had all survived intact.

Fears had grown for the 'really irreplaceable' stained-glass windows, dating back to the 13th century, amid the heat of the fire last night.

The status of other relics, including a purported piece of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, remained unclear today.

French priest Jean-Marc Fournier led the efforts to save the Crown of Thorns.

Etienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.

This was confirmed by an emergency services source who said: 'Father Fournier is an absolute hero.

'He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.'

More than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the eight-centuries-old cathedral. They worked through the night to bring the fire under control some 14 hours after it began.

France's richest man Bernard Arnault pledges €200MILLION to repair Notre Dame - doubling the €100million donated by Salma Hayek's billionaire husband France's richest man has pledged €200m (£170m) towards the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, doubling the donation of Salma Hayek's husband. Multi-billionaire Bernard Arnault, head of the LVMH luxury goods group, instantly became the biggest benefactor of an appeal launched by President Emmanuel Macron. On Monday – the day of the blaze – French tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault, who is married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100 million euros (£86.2 million) towards the rebuilding of the Cathedral. But, in a statement, the LVMH group said their donation would be double that. It said: 'The Arnault family and the LVMH group, in solidarity with this national tragedy, are associated with the reconstruction of this extraordinary cathedral, symbol of France, its heritage and its unity. A statement from Francois-Henri Pinault said: 'This tragedy impacts all French people' and 'everyone wants to restore life as quickly as possible to this jewel of our heritage.' Advertisement

One firefighter was injured; no one else was reported hurt in the blaze which began after the building was closed to the public for the evening.

Shortly after the the blaze broke out, French fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, the husband of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100million euros (£86 million) towards the restoration effort.

Hours later, French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced that his family and his LVMH luxury goods group would donate 200million euros to help with repairs.

French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral, whatever the cost.

He said in a speech outside the church: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre-Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.'

Pope Francis said Tuesday he hoped everyone would pull together to rebuild the devastated Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris following a massive fire.

'I hope the Notre-Dame cathedral may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilization of all, a jewel in the heart of the city,' Francis said in a statement issued by the Vatican.

Leaders from around the world offered their condolences to France. Among them was Queen Elizabeth II, who said: 'Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.

'I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.

'My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.'

Notre Dame had previously the site of a terror scare in 2016 when a car carrying seven gas cylinders was found near the cathedral.

Three women were arrested over the alleged terror plot, although they were thought to have been targeting a Paris railway station rather than the cathedral itself.

Police have made clear today that they believe Monday night's fire was an accident.

Investigators will not be able to enter the cathedral's blackened nave until experts are satisfied its stone walls withstood the heat and the building is structurally sound.

'The fire is fully extinguished,' fire service spokesman Gabriel Plus told reporters. 'Our job today is to monitor the structure and its movements.'

The fire swiftly ripped through the cathedral's timbered roof supports, where workmen had been carrying out extensive renovations to collapsed balustrades and crumbling gargoyles, as well as the spire's wooden frame.

The hero who saved the Crown of Thorns: Fire brigade chaplain entered flaming Notre Dame to recover holy relic - three years after he bravely helped Bataclan terror victims Father Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing Notre Dame cathedral A French priest who helped comfort the wounded after the Bataclan terror attack today also emerged as a hero of the Notre Dame fire. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing cathedral on Monday night. It was feared that both religious artefacts would be lost as flames engulfed the medieval building, but Father Fournier made sure they were taken to safety.

Hundreds of stunned onlookers had lined the banks of the Seine river late into the night as the fire raged, reciting prayers and singing liturgical music in harmony as they stood in vigil.

'It's a symbol of our country that risked being destroyed,' Culture Minister Franck Riester said.

Notre-Dame is owned by the state and has been at the centre of a years-long row between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should bear the brunt of costs for badly needed restoration work.

Paolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace at which the fire spread through the cathedral had been stunning.

'We are used to thinking about them as eternal simply because they have been there for centuries, or a thousand years, but the reality is they are very fragile,' Violini said.

American tourist Susan Hargrove said she'd been left breathless by the scale of devastation.

'We are talking of world history, of our Western culture but also of something that is truly universal,' Hargrove said. 'Notre-Dame means something to everybody.'

Firefighters also struggled to take down many of the large paintings in the cathedral, administrative cleric Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said, meaning the scale of the devastation will not be known for some time.

A French cultural heritage expert this morning claimed that France no longer has trees big enough to replace ancient wooden beams that fell during the blaze.

But at the height of the inferno, many feared the entire building would be lost.

'If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It's the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,' Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told French TV.

In Washington, Donald Trump tweeted: 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.'

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby sent the best wishes of the Anglican church to people at the scene. 'Tonight we pray for the firefighters tackling the tragic Notre Dame fire - and for everyone in France and beyond who watches and weeps for this beautiful, sacred place where millions have met with Jesus Christ,' he said.

And British Prime Minister Theresa May added: 'My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze.'

There was an air of mourning in Paris as the sun rose on Tuesday with hundreds of people gathering on the banks of the Seine to view the devastation at Notre Dame.

An elderly woman wondered whether the fire was a sign from god, saying: 'Notre Dame is our soul. The soul of France.

'We are a Catholic country, a republic but a Catholic country nonetheless - nobody remembers that any more.'

She said she had heard the statue of the Virgin Mary had been saved, adding that it could be a miracle.

Another woman said: 'I think it can be rebuilt, but it could take years and years - I am 79 and today, I don't know if I will ever see Notre Dame whole again.'

As the sun rose over the building, ashes from the cathedral's spire blew across the banks of the river, along with the blossom from Notre Dame's gardens.

Miraculously, the trees and vines around the building on Ile de la Cite were barely singed, while the bell towers and the enormous circular window of the nave appeared to be intact.

Despite the fierce heat that consumed Notre Dame's spire, scaffolding previously erected for restoration work was also still standing.

One refuse working collecting litter on the banks of the Seine said: 'It's incredible (the scaffolding) didn't fall.'

Daniel Etieve, 70, said: 'It's a very sad picture. For over 800 years this cathedral has been passed from generation to generation.

Firefighters douse flames billowing from the roof as they try to stop the flames spreading. Nobody has been injured, junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said at the scene, adding: 'It's too early to determine the causes of the fire'

'Now I question what state we will pass it on to the generations after us.'

One man, who gave his name only as Fabrice, said he was grieving for the incredible timber beams and wooden carvings that characterised Notre Dame's vaulted ceiling.

The 55-year-old art historian said: 'The ceiling was known as 'the forest' because of all the thousands of trees that were cut to build it. I feel very sad but also I am happy that most of the building is still here.'

He added that Notre Dame has been built over many centuries and that he took comfort in the way the British had repaired Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992.

'But it's hard to believe that this is happening in Paris - part of ourselves has been destroyed,' he said.

'I always go for a walk in this area every day and come to see Notre Dame. It's like coming to visit an elderly parent.'

One commuter said: 'I come often to Notre Dame for mass and to pray and (the damage) is tearing at my heart.'

But he added: 'Luckily it was saved. It was not completely destroyed and, as the president said, we will have money to rebuild it and I hope it will be even more beautiful.'

Accountant Martin Cassan, 32, was hopeful for the future. He had come down to the scene with friends to watch the cathedral burn on Monday evening.

He said: 'There's nothing you can do but have a drink. You feel sad. You definitely feel sad.'

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted shortly after the fire broke out that he was sad to see 'a part of us burn' and sent his sympathies to people across France

But he asked: 'Should it be (rebuilt) exactly the same as before? Will it be like the Louvre - will we have a pyramid in the middle of it?'

Another onlooker, ",
ho gave his name only as Clement, said: 'As sad as it is, it reminds us that buildings are just temporary, just as we are.',
,,,,
During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-Catholic violence. Its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.,,
,,,,
It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.,,
,,,,
The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24,1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.,,
,,,,
Before yesterday's blaze it was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding, and bronze statues had been removed last week for works.,,
,,,,
Its 330ft-long roof, of which a large section was consumed in the first hour of the blaze, was one of the oldest such structures in Paris.,,
,,,,
Parisians took to the city's streets last night to pray, sing and reminisce about Notre Dame cathedral as it burned before them,,,
,,,,
The emotions became too much for some locals who gathered in the shadow of the cathedral to watch its slow destruction,,,,
,,,,
I walked through the gutted cathedral… then the crucifix shone from what remained of the altar, a symbol of defiance in the gloom: ROBERT HARDMAN is among first witnesses inside ravaged Notre Dame,,,
,,,,
Sparks and bits of flaming woodwork are still cascading from the remnants of the 12th-century roof.,,,,
